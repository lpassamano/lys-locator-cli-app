TO DO;
1. Readme file - description, install instructions, contributors guide, link to license
2. record video demo of the gem
4. blog post - reflect on decision to not create location class, process of creating gem, project in general
   - other mistakes: github flubs (def accidentally commited when i meant to run the program;
   also may have included changes that were not described in the message)
5. review code to make sure indenting and spacing is good and see if any further refactoring can be done to make it more understandable
6. check to make sure class/instance variable use is correct
*7. make sure all classes and methods describe what they do accurately

9. check use of #each and see if collect or another method would make better sense (sandwich code)

11. create methods in Store for more_information attributes that either displays it or scrapes for it
    @attribute || = Scraper.... (|| mean if it has no assigned value to do what is to the right of the ||)

13. change name of Store.all -- doesn't actually store all stores, just the ones from current search



TEST ZIP CODES:

CLI - controlls the cli interface
V
Scraper - scrapes site to create store instances
V
SearchTerm - tracks all stores that appear for a specific search
(add in this class later to track different types of search inputs)

V
Store - creates new stores and stores them in a class variable (array)
- one attribute is a array of search term, if zip is not already in there it gets added
